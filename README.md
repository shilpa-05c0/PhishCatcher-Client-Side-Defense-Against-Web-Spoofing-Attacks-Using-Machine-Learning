# PhishCatcher-Client-Side-Defense-Against-Web-Spoofing-Attacks-Using-Machine-Learning
PhishCatcher is a machine learning-based client-side defense system designed to detect and prevent web spoofing attacks (phishing) in real-time. The project leverages ML models to analyze webpage features and classify them as either legitimate or phishing, helping users stay safe while browsing.

Features
--------
-Detects phishing websites using machine learning models
-Works on client-side for real-time defense
-Extracts URL and webpage features for classification
-Lightweight and efficient for deployment
-Improves browsing safety against web spoofing attacks

Tech Stack
----------
-Programming Language: Python / Java (based on your code)
-Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM
-Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
-Visualization: Matplotlib / Seaborn
-Deployment: Client-side application

How It Works
------------
-Extracts key features from input URLs/webpages (e.g., length of URL, presence of suspicious characters, SSL certificate info).
-Uses trained ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM) to classify webpages.
-Alerts users if a page is likely to be phishing.
